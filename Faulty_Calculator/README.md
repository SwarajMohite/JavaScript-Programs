# Faulty Calculator

<h3>This JavaScript program performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. However, it introduces an element of randomness where there is a 10% chance that the program will intentionally provide incorrect results. The purpose of this Faulty element is to demonstrate error handling and user interaction .</h3>
<h3>Using the program described can help students from standard 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., learn and verify basic arithmetic operations while ensuring they understand the fundamentals rather than relying solely on calculators.</h3>
This will improve Students Power of Thinking. :)
